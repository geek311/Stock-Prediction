# Stock-Prediction

Accurately predicting Stock Prices has been a long-standing problem that mankind has tried to solve. While there is no model that exists, which can accurately and with complete certainty predict all stock prices accurately, yet this is one of the most interesting problems that can be dealt with by using Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Given the past historical
   
performance of stocks, this project tries to solve of the problem of predicting the stock prices in the market as accurately as possible. The problem is replicable and quantifiable.

## Datasets
S&P 500 Full dataset - Data will be downloaded for S&P 500 stocks into a “Stocks” folder. Later this data will also be uploaded in a folder in S3 bucket which the model can use.
